Developed using a local installation of LESS via npm.  

The compiled CSS file (styles.css) is referenced in the HTML.  To switch skins, simply comment out the skin in styles.less that you don't want and uncomment the one you do, then run the LESS compiler again.

Please let me know if there are any issues (there shouldn't be any)!
